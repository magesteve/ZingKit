/// Swift based Animation Sequencer for UIView style animation.
///
/// Using chained dot notation, a developer can create a sequence of animation commands (internally called a cell).
/// Once created, the sequence can be executed (start the animation running), and once running, the sequence can be
/// safely canceled.
///
/// Most cells are executed in a sequential manner, where each cell is started and finished before the next cell is
/// started. Thus a list of cells (the Zing object) starts when the first cell starts, and ends when the last cell
/// finishes. Most cells have associated closures.
///
/// UIView style animation involves changing animatable properties of a UIVIew within an UIView.animate() call.
/// Apple's documentation describes this in more detail.  An animation cell defined by the thenAnimate() call invokes
/// the associated closure within a UIView.animate() call.
///
/// Other cells can be timed delays (nothing happening until the delay is over), non-animated immediate actions
/// (ie. not within UIView.animate call) or immediate animated actions (called within UIView.animate). Both of the
/// last two immediate actions do not wait for the animation to complete but immediately calls the next cell in
/// the sequence.
///
/// Zing is well suited for simple sequence of UIView animation. It is not designed for interactive animations,
/// thought it can animate background views within game.
